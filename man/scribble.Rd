\usage{
scribble()
}
\description{
Opens the \code{scribblr} note editor in a new window.
}
\details{
\code{scribblr} integrates a minimalist note editor within RStudio,
useful for taking quick project-related notes without distractions. Each
RStudio project has associated its own note file, which can be
read and modified by calling \code{scribble()} from an RStudio session with
the active project. If \code{scribble()} is called from a session without any
active project, a global note file (located at the R home directory) is
accessed.

Calling \code{scribble()} opens the \code{scribblr} project notes editor
in a new window. Notes are autosaved when the editor is closed; until that
moment, the R session will remain busy.

\code{scribble()} can also be called (and, in particular, associated a
custom keystroke) via the RStudio Addin "Open scribblr note editor".
