[my R-universe repository](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/), with:

``` r
install.packages("scribblr", repos = "https://vgherard.r-universe.dev")
```

or equivalently from [GitHub](https://github.com/vgherard/scribblr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vgherard/scribblr")
```
